"My order was delivered on time"
i think delivery time is not that important because you will get your package eventually 
but "Contents of my order was as i expected" is very important
because people expects what they buy
if something is there that they didnt buy or something isn't there that they did buy they will be sad
so second questions piority should be higher than others
"i ordered everything i wanted to order" is not a very good question
maybe they are poor so they cant buy our products or our prices is so high that they cant buy
its an important question that shows the prices are good
but about happiness is not so relevant
"i paid good price for my order" is a good question that they buy good products cheap
but if they pay good price and they didnt get what they want its not that important
i think this question is the least important question about customer happiness
"i am satisfied with my courier" is second most important question
because they want their products are safe and not broken so this question is important
"the app makes ordering easy for me" is not relevant about happiness it maybe hard to buy products but if the service is good enough its not important

for the question priority i made
